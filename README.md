# Gazer

## Setup - user
```bash
export MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<...>
export MYSQL_GAZER_PASSWORD=<...>
gaze
```

## Setup - dev
```bash
export MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<...>
export MYSQL_GAZER_PASSWORD=<...>
gaze --build
```

## Optional config
MYSQL_GAZER_USER (default=gazer)
MYSQL_GAZER_DATABASE (default=gazer)

## About
- Uses layered jars to achieve faster builds
- Uses docker-entrypoint-initdb.d from mysql docker image to setup gazer user for mysql, see docker-compose.yml
- ./gaze checks for necessary environment variables and runs docker-compose up
- docker-compose down deletes data, stop does not
- If timeout for database startup is not enough, edit it in wfi_args in docker-compose.yml
- has dev and prod profile - dev uses H2, and is selected automatically when running bootRun Gradle task. The prod 
profile is selected in Dockerfile. Fails fast if no profile is selected.
- API is permissive - on update will accept even fields we don't update
- checkInterval is restricted to >10 seconds to prevent DOSing (although still possible to create many users each with the same endpoint)
- custom messages not implemented 
- [Problems](https://docs.spring.io/spring-hateoas/docs/1.1.0.M3/reference/html/#mediatypes.http-problem) are not 
implemented, errors are returned with content-type JSON, not HAL_FORMS_JSON

## Known issues
### Gazer
- client.get can't be mocked
- actor (ro more likely channels) cause tests to go into infinite loop
- gazer tests can only be run one class at a time
