## About
- Uses layered jars to achieve faster builds
- Uses docker-entrypoint-initdb.d from mysql docker image to setup gazer user for mysql, see docker-compose.yml
- ./gaze checks for necessary environment variables and runs docker-compose up
- docker-compose down deletes data, stop does not
- If timeout for database startup is not enough, edit it in wfi_args in docker-compose.yml
- has dev and prod profile - dev uses H2, and is selected automatically when running bootRun Gradle task. The prod 
profile is selected in Dockerfile. Fails fast if no profile is selected.
- API is permissive - on update will accept even fields we don't update
- checkInterval is restricted to >10 seconds to prevent DOSing (although still possible to create many users each with the same endpoint)
- custom messages not implemented
